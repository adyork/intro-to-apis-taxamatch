## Regular Expressions

To teach regular expressions, instructors have used:

- [slides](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-data-intro/blob/gh-pages/files/regexslides.pdf) to quiz the audience on examples.
- Pen and paper, to work through exercises before using a tool and to explain that there can be multiple answers to the same question. 
- Whiteboard with text examples and quized participants on regex approaches.
- Online tools such as: [Regxr](https://regexr.com/), [regex101](https://regex101.com/), [rexegper](http://regexper.com/), [myregexp](http://myregexp.com/), or whichever service you prefer.
- Used quiz/exercise files in [https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-data-intro/tree/gh-pages/files](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-data-intro/tree/gh-pages/files).

General guidance:

- Due to time constraints, it is best to choose the exercises that match the needs of the local community that will be attending the workshop.
- Point to lesson quiz and exercises for additional practice/homework.
