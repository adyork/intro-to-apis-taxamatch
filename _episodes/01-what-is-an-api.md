## What is an API?

## What goes in a Request?

## What goes in a Response?

## Response Codes

## Examine an API

~~~
$ curl http://numbersapi.com/42
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
42 is the number of laws of cricket.

{: .output}

[Numbers API][numbersapi] provides facts about numbers. By putting the number of
interest into the address, we tell Numbers API which number to give a fact
about. By adding other keywords to the address, we can refine the domain that
we're asking for information in; for example, for specifically mathematical
trivia, we can add `/math`.

~~~
$ curl http://numbersapi.com/42/math
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
42 is a perfect score on the USA Math Olympiad (USAMO) and International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).

{: .output}

Numbers API is not an especially sophisticated API. In particular, it only
offers a single _endpoint_ (specifically, `/`), and each response to a query is
a single string, provided as plain text.

We can think of an API as being similar to a package or library in a programming
language, but one that is usable from almost any programming language. In these
terms, an endpoint is equivalent to a function; Numbers API provides a single
function, `/`, which gives information about numbers. The response is the return
value of the function, and in this case is a single string. This maps well onto
HTTP, as the response body of a request is a string of either characters or of
bytes. (Byte strings don't translate well between languages, so are usually
avoided, except for specific portable formats such as images.)

However, many useful functions need to return something other than character
strings. For example, you might want to return a list, or an array, or a set of
related data. Let's look at another example of a web API and see how this can be
handled. [Newton][newton] is a web API for advanced mathematics. One thing it
can do is factorization:

~~~
$ curl https://newton.now.sh/api/v2/factor/x^2-1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
{"operation":"factor","expression":"x^2-1","result":"(x - 1) (x + 1)"}
~~~
{: .output}

Two things have changed. Firstly, now instead of `/`, we are specifying that we
want to use the `factor` endpoint provided by the `v2` version of the API. This
is a very common way of structuring APIs: firstly a version, and then one or
more levels of endpoints to specify what function you would like the API to
perform.

Secondly, rather than a plain text response, we get a data structure. This is
still encoded as plain text (because HTTP can't natively transmit much else),
but we can't use the text directly&mdash;instead, we need to parse it, first.
The syntax used here is the most common format for modern web APIs, and is
called JSON (pronounced like the name "Jason"; short for JavaScript Object
Notation). (You may also encounter older or more old-fashioned APIs that instead
use XML, the eXtensible Markup Language.) We can see that this response includes
three names, or _keys_ (`"operation"`, `"expression"`, and `"result"`), and
three associated _values_ (`"factor"`, `"x^2-1"`, and `"(x - 1) ( x + 1)"`,
respectively).

`factor` is not the only thing that Newton can do. Let's try a different
endpoint, for integration.

~~~
$ curl https://newton.now.sh/api/v2/integrate/x^2-1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
{"operation":"integrate","expression":"x^2-1","result":"1/3 x^3 - x"}
~~~
{: .output}

In this case Newton correctly tells us that the `"result"` of this integration
is `"1/3 x^3 - x"`.

The endpoints an API offers, and what format it will give its responses in, will
generally be listed in the API's documentation. Newton's documentation for
example can be found [on GitHub][newton-docs].

## Authentication and identification

Many web APIs restrict access to registered users or applications. This may be
because they are used to control things that are specific to a particular user
account, because different people have different privilege levels and so
different endpoints available, or simply because the API provider wants to
collect statistics on how the API is being used.

Various ways exist for developers to authenticate to an API, including:

* A username and password, via HTTP [basic][basic-auth] or [digest][digest-auth]
  authentication;
* An authentication token (to identify you) or API key (to identify your
  application), generated on a developer dashboard page; and
* OAuth tokens, generated programmatically&mdash;these are particularly useful
  for applications used by others to log into their own accounts, so your
  application never sees the credentials used.

For everything other than HTTP authentication, there are also a variety of ways
to present the credential to the server, such as:

* As a query parameter;
* In an extra header in the request;
* Encoded in, for example, JSON in the request body;
* As a [cookie][cookie]; and
* As an HTTP password, with or without a username.

One important fact about HTTP is that it is _stateless_: each request is treated
entirely separately, with no memory from one request to the next. This means
that you must present your authentication credentials with every request you
make to the API. (This is in contrast to other protocols like SSH or FTP, where
you authenticate once at the start of a session, and then subsequent messages
can be sent back and forth without the need for re-authentication.)

For example, NASA offers an API that exposes much of the data that they make
public. They require an API key to identify you, but don't require any
authentication beyond this.

Let's try working with the NASA API now. To do this, first we need to generate
our API key by providing our details at [the API home page][nasa-api]. Once that
is done, NASA provide the API key instantly, and send a copy to the email
address you provide. They helpfully also provide an example of an API query to
try, querying the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD). This shows us that NASA
expects the API key to be encoded as a query parameter.

We can see that this API gives us JSON output including a links to two versions
of the picture of the day, and then metadata about the picture including its
title, description, and copyright. The headers also give us some information
about our API usage&mdash;our rate limit is 2000 requests per day, and we have
1998 of these remaining (probably because the malware scanner on my email server
tested the link first to make sure it wasn't malicious).

With all of these ways to provide identification and authentication information,
we don't have time to cover each possibility exhaustively. For the vast majority
of APIs, there will exist good developer documentation that provides examples of
how to use the token or other identifier that they provide to connect to their
service, including examples.


## More complicated queries

Thus far we have queried APIs where any parameters are included as part of the
effective "filename" on the server. For example, in `http://numbersapi.com/42`,
the `42` is a parameter to the API, but at first glance it could equally well be
an endpoint.

Many APIs make this distinction more clear, by accepting arguments in a _query
string_. This is a sequence of `name=value` pairs, separated from each other by
`&`s, and separated from the endpoint by a `?`. 

> ## Using quotes with Curl
> When we put an & into a web address for Curl we need to put it inside quotes. If we don't then our shell will interpret them as meaning we should run the preceeding command in the background instead of passing it as a parameter to curl. This will effectively truncate the address to everything up to the first &.
{: .callout}

We have already seen one example of this&mdash;we used it to provide our API key
to NASA's APOD endpoint. The APOD endpoint also accepts other parameters, for
example, to select the date or dates for which the picture is returned.

One benefit of being able to construct queries in this way is that the query is
more self-descriptive&mdash;for unfamiliar APIs, keyword arguments are
significantly easier to read than positional ones.

One other way to provide parameters, in particular when they are more complex
data structures than can be easily represented in a small string, is to use JSON
in the body of the request. Since constructing JSON by hand is tedious, we will
defer such APIs to the next section.
