So far, we have been interacting with web APIs by using `curl` to send HTTP requests and then inspecting the responses at the command line. This is very useful for running quick checks that we are able to access the API, and debugging if we're not. However, to integrate web APIs into our software and analyses, we'd like to be able to make requests of web APIs from within Python, and work with the results.

In principle we could make subprocess calls to `curl`, and capture and parse the results, but this would be very cumbersome. Fortunately, other people thought the same thing, and have made libraries available to help with this. Basic functionality around making and processing requests is built into the Python standard library, but far more popular is to use a package called `requests`, which is available from PyPI.

First off, let's check that we have `requests` installed.

~~~
$ python -m requests
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If you see the message:

~~~
/Users/ed/anaconda3_x86/bin/python: No module named requests.__main__; 'requests' is a package and cannot be directly executed
~~~
{: .output}

then `requests` is already installed. If on the other hand you see the message

~~~
/Users/ed/anaconda3_x86/bin/python: No module named requests
~~~
{: .output}

then install `requests` from `pip`:

~~~
$ pip install requests
~~~
{: .language-bash}


## Recap

As a reminder, communication with web APIs is done through the HTTP protocol,
and happens through _messages_, which are of two kinds: _requests_ and _responses_.

A request is composed of 
a start line, a number of headers and an optional body.
Practically,
a request needs to specify one of the HTTP _verbs_ 
and a URL 
in the start line
and an optional payload (the body).

A response is composed of 
a status line, a number of headers and an optional body. 

The data to be transferred 
with the body of a request
needs to be represented in some way.
"Unstructured" text representations are used,
e.g., to transmit CSV data.
A popular text-based (ASCII) format to transmit data 
is the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.
The Python standard library
includes a module to deal with JSON,
for serialisation
(i.e. representing Python objects 
as JSON strings):

~~~
import json
data = dict(a=1, b=dict(c=(2,3,4)))
representation = json.dumps(data)
representation
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
'{"a": 1, "b": {"c": [2, 3, 4]}}'
~~~
{: .output}

And for parsing
(i.e. recovering python objects 
from their JSON string representation):

~~~
data_reparsed = json.loads(representation)
data_reparsed
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': [2, 3, 4]}}
~~~
{: .output}

You can see that for `dicts` containing strings, integers, and lists, at least, the JSON representation looks very similar to the Python representation. The two are not always directly interchangeable, however.

The Python `requests` library 
can parse JSON and serialise the objects,
so that you don't have to deal with this aspect on your own.

Another ASCII format that is used with APIs
is the eXtensible Markup Language (XML),
which is much more complex to deal with than JSON.
Facilities to deal with the XML format are 
in the `xml.etree.ElementTree` library.

Another markup language widely used 
in HTTP message bodies
is the HyperText Markup Language, HTML.


## HTTP verbs

Up until now we have exclusively used GET requests, to retrieve information from a server. In fact, the HTTP protocol has a number of such _verbs_, 
each associated with an operation falling in
one of four categories: Create, Read, Update, or Delete (sometimes called the _CRUD_ categories).
The most common verbs are:

- GET: to read resources (these requests have no body);
- POST: to create new resources;
- PUT: to update/replace existing resources; 
- PATCH: to update/modify existing resources;
- DELETE: to delete resources.

In this lesson we will focus on GET and POST requests only.


## A GET request example

Let's take the first example we looked at earlier, 
now with the Python `requests` library:

~~~
import requests
response = requests.get("http://www.carpentries.org")
~~~
{: .language-python}

`requests` gives us access to both the headers and the body of the response.
Looking at the headers first, we can look at what type of data is in the body.
As this is the URL of a website, 
we expect the reponse to contain a web page:

~~~
response.headers["Content-Type"]
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
text/html
~~~
{: .output}

Our expectations are confirmed. We can also check the `Content-Length` header to see how much data we expect to find in the body:

~~~
response.headers["Content-Length"]
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
55036
~~~
{: .output}

And, as expected,
the length of the body of the response
is the same:
~~~
len(response.text)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
55036
~~~
{: .output}

We can look at the content of the body:

~~~
response.text
~~~
{: .language-python}

This shows us the same HTML source code as we obtained from `curl` earlier.


## GET with parameters

Let's now look at using `requests` to connect to an API rather than a plain web site.
For this, we'll use the Met Office DataPoint API. To do this, you will need an
API key. If you don't already have an API for the Met Office DataPoint, then
follow the instructions on the [Setup][setup] page now.

The first step when working with API keys is to load the key into memory. This
can either be done from a file, or by specifying the key directly in a settings
file.

~~~
api_key = open("metoffice-api-key.txt",'r').read().strip()
~~~
{: .language-python}

Looking at the [Met Office API reference][metoffice-api-reference],
we can build a url to access the current forecasts
for Swansea:

~~~
base_metoffice_url = "http://datapoint.metoffice.gov.uk/public/data/"
resource = "val/wxfcs/all/json/310149"
url = base_metoffice_url + resource
url
~~~
{: .language-python}

As shown in the API reference,
this time we need to pass 2 parameters in the request:
a resource description, and the API key,
in order for the Met Office server to identify us.

As we saw in the previous episode, with `curl` from the command line,
we would have to use the following command

~~~
$ curl "http://datapoint.metoffice.gov.uk/public/data/val/wxfcs/all/json/310149?res=3hourly&key=$(cat metoffice-api-key.txt)" | less
~~~
{: .language-bash}

building the parameter string explicitly.
This is also the syntax that is used 
in a browser address bar:

~~~
"protocol://host/resource/path?parname1=value1&parname2=value2..."
~~~

However, using the `requests` library allows us to use a nicer syntax:

~~~
response = requests.get(url, params={"res":"3hourly", "key":api_key})
response
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Response [200]>
~~~
{: .output}

As we saw previously, the code 200 means "success".
To make sure the response contains what we expect,
let's quickly print its headers 
(which has the structure of a dictionary):

~~~
for key, value in response.headers.items():
    print((key, value)) 
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
('Server', 'WaveServer 1.0')
('ETag', '1615686466177')
('Content-Type', 'application/json')
('WebServer', '-PROD-01')
('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
('Content-Encoding', 'gzip')
('Content-Length', '1051')
('Cache-Control', 'public, no-transform, must-revalidate, max-age=611')
('Expires', 'Sun, 14 Mar 2021 12:38:16 GMT')
('Date', 'Sun, 14 Mar 2021 12:28:05 GMT')
('Connection', 'keep-alive')
('Vary', 'Accept-Encoding')
~~~
{: .output}

As expected the `Content-Type` is `application-json`.
We can now look at the body of the response:

~~~
response.text[:100]
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
'{"SiteRep":{"Wx":{"Param":[{"name":"F","units":"C","$":"Feels Like Temperature"},{"name":"G","units"
~~~
{: .output}

As mentioned, the `requests` library 
can parse this JSON representation 
and return a more convenient Python object,
using which we can access the inner data:

~~~
data = response.json()
data["SiteRep"]["Wx"]
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Authentication and POST 

As mentioned above, thus far we have only used GET requests. GET requests are
intended to be used for retrieving data, without modifying any
state&mdash;effectively, "look, but don't touch". To modify state, other HTTP
verbs should be used instead. Most commonly used for this purpose in web APIs
are POST requests.

Since the Met Office don't especially want us to modify their forecasts&mdash;as
much as we might like to modify the weather. As such, we'll switch to using the
GitHub API to look at how POST requests can be used.

This will require a GitHub Personal Access Token. If you don't already have one, then the instructions in the [Setup][setup] walk through how to obtain one.

To POST requests, we can use the function `requests.post`.

For this example, we are going 
to post a comment on an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mmesiti/aimlac-cdt-2021-03/issues/1).
Issues on GitHub are a simple way 
to keep track of bugs, 
and a great way to manage focused discussions
on the code. 

In order to do so, we need to authenticate.
We will now create an object 
of the `HTTPBasicAuth` class
provided by `requests`,
and pass it to `requests.post`.

First of all, let's load the GitHub access token:

~~~
ghtoken = open("github-access-token.txt",'r').read().strip()
~~~
{: .language-python}

Let's then create the `HTTPBasicAuth` object:

~~~
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
auth = HTTPBasicAuth("your-github-username",ghtoken)
~~~
{: .language-python}

We will now create the body of the comment,
as a JSON string:

~~~
import json
body = json.dumps({"body": "Another test comment"})
~~~
{: .language-python}

Finally, we will post the comment on GitHub
and make sure we get a success code:

~~~
response = requests.post(url="https://api.github.com/repos/mmesiti/aimlac-cdt-2021-03/issues/1/comments",
              data=body,
              auth=auth)
response
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Response [201]>
~~~
{: .output}

The code 201 is the typical success response 
for a POST request, 
signaling that the creation of a resource 
has been successful.
We can go to the [issue page][mmesiti-issues]
and check that our new comment is there.

Authentication is a vast topic.
The `requests` library implements a number 
of authentication mechanisms that you can use.
To handle authentication for multiple requests,
one could also use a `Session` object 
from the `requests` library
(see [Advanced Usage][advanced-requests]).
